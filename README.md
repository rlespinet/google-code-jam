# Solutions for Google Code Jam problems

This repository contains my solutions to some of the
[Google code jam](#https://code.google.com/codejam/) problems.
(Mainly C++/Golang).

# Compiling and running solutions

Each individual solution directory contains a Makefile. You can
build the solution by running

    make all
    
and run program on the input files with

    make run

The root Makefile can be used to build/run the solutions for all
the problems.
